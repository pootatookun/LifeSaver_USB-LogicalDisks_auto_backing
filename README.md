Windows Denfender doesn't seem to like exe created by Pyinstaller. It will mark files as trojan.
Disable windows defender real time protection before extracting the zip. Put the zip in drive, of which you don't want bakup of, add this folder to Defender's trust list.
And don't move the extracted folder anywhere else, without unconfiguring the task using the program.
